# RAG-for-Healthcare

This is a RAG based chatbot trained using healthcare related data. There are two streamlit web applications PandasAIAgent.py and RAG_Chatbot.py, both allowing users to ask questions about diseases and health, and receive answers generated by a language model, using the data from a CSV file and a pdf file respectively.

Here are some sample output for reference:
